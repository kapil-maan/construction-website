        <br>
        ➧ <b>Bolder’s Construction</b> is proud to announce that one of our projects, <b>the Green Valley School</b>, has been awarded the Green Building Award 
        by the <b>Ministry of Environment and Forests</b>, for its outstanding efforts in reducing the environmental impact of its construction and operation. 
        The Green Building Award is a prestigious recognition that honors the best practices and innovations in the field of green building and sustainable 
        development.
        <br><br>
        ➧ <b>The Green Valley School</b> is a state-of-the-art educational facility in Hyderabad, designed to promote environmental awareness and social 
        responsibility among students and staff. The school was completed in 2020 by Bolder’s Construction, a leading company in the field of 
        building and engineering. The school features a bioclimatic design, a natural ventilation system, a waste management system, and a organic 
        farm.
        <br><br>
        ➧ The bioclimatic design of the school takes into account the local climate and site conditions, and optimizes the orientation, shape, and 
        materials of the building to reduce the energy consumption and enhance the thermal comfort. The school uses passive solar heating, cooling, 
        and lighting techniques, such as solar chimneys, louvers, and skylights, to regulate the temperature and illumination of the indoor spaces.
        <br><br>
        ➧ The natural ventilation system of the school uses the wind and the stack effect to create a continuous airflow throughout the building, 
        and to improve the indoor air quality and health. The school also has a green roof and a vertical garden, that provide insulation, shading, 
        and oxygen, and also create a pleasant and attractive environment.
        <br><br>
        ➧ The waste management system of the school collects, segregates, and treats the solid and liquid waste generated by the school, and converts 
        it into useful resources. The school has a composting unit, a biogas plant, and a vermicomposting unit, that produce organic fertilizer and 
        biogas from the organic waste. The school also has a rainwater harvesting system, a greywater recycling system, and a sewage treatment plant, 
        that provide clean water for irrigation and flushing.
        <br><br>
        ➧ The organic farm of the school is a learning and recreational space, where the students and staff can grow and harvest their own fruits, 
        vegetables, and herbs, using organic farming methods and techniques. The farm also has a poultry, a dairy, and a beekeeping unit, that provide 
        fresh eggs, milk, and honey for the school. The farm also teaches the students and staff about the importance of food security, nutrition, 
        and biodiversity.
        <br><br>
        ➧ <b>The Green Valley School</b> is a model of green education, and has been recognized as one of the most eco-friendly and innovative schools in the 
        country. The school has received positive feedback and appreciation from the students, staff, parents, and the community. The school has also 
        inspired other schools and institutions to adopt green building and sustainable development practices.
        <br><br>
        ➧ <b>The Green Valley School</b> is a testament to the vision, skill, and values of Bolder’s Construction, and its contribution to the building and 
        engineering industry. The school is also a reflection of the commitment and responsibility of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and 
        its support and encouragement for the green building and sustainable development movement. The Green Valley School is not just a school, but 
        a symbol of excellence and sustainability.
